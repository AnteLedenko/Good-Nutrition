### Descripton
Good Nutrition is a website that provides information about nutrition. The Good Nutrition home page is an introduction to the website. The second and third pages provide more information about nutrition with some interactive parts, and the fourth and last page is a calorie calculator with a search bar.

- Good nutrition (index.html): Navigation through the website is through a navigation bar that contains 3 buttons and a h1 element in the heading that contains a link to get back to the home page. Besides information, this page only contains a few external links in the footer.

- Macronutrients: The second page on the website macronutrients contains a few containers that provide information about them and their functions, and then we also have a few source containers that contain a certain number of buttons that, on click, push and remove text. The idea behind this was to manipulate the DOM and change the visual appearance of the website with interaction.

- Micronutrients: Similar to the previous page, the micronutrients page provides some containers with information about them and then a few source containers, but instead of text, this time a button on click push and remove graphics, so the idea behind this page was the same as the previous page, just using graphics this time.

- Calculator: The fourth and last page on this website contains a calculator. So here we have a calculator with 3 inputs and two buttons: add and calculate. The idea is to provide values in all the inputs and click on the add button, which will then push values into 3 separate containers under the input and add the delete button so we can remove the values if we want to, and once done with providing values, the calculate button on click will convert our input from a string to a number and calculate the result and push it into the result container.
- Also under the calculator there is another text input, a search bar that filters an array of items and displays the results in a container. The idea here is so that the user of the website can have easy access to information that he can use in the calculator above.
